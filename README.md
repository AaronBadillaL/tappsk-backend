# Tappsk-Backend

**Tappsk-Backend** is a backend application built with **Node.js** and **Mongoose**. This project is part of my portfolio, designed to demonstrate my skills in backend development, specifically in creating RESTful APIs with **Express** and working with **MongoDB** using **Mongoose**. 

The application follows a modular and scalable architecture, and it is built with a focus on learning and improving my skills in modern JavaScript development.

## Key Features
- **Node.js** with **Express** to build fast and scalable RESTful APIs.
- **Mongoose** for interacting with MongoDB, simplifying database operations.
- **JWT-based authentication** for secure access control.
- Modular code structure for easy maintenance and scalability.
- Used for learning and showcasing my backend development skills.
