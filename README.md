**Tappsk-Backend** is a backend application developed with Node.js and Mongoose. This project is part of my portfolio, showcasing my skills in RESTful API development, NoSQL database management, and best practices in backend architecture using JavaScript. The application connects to a MongoDB database, enabling efficient and scalable data management.

**Key Features:**
- **Node.js** and **Express** for a fast and lightweight API.
- **Mongoose** as the ORM for robust and simplified MongoDB interactions.
- Modular and organized structure for easy scalability and maintainability.
- **User validation** and **authentication** to ensure secure user experiences.
